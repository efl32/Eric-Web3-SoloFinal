        <h1>Main Building</h1>
        <p>Founded in 1891, Drexel University was built on the cornerstone that a university needs to meet the needs of a rapidly growing society, preparing students for careers in every industry. Today Drexel is a world-renowned research university with three campuses in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and over 26,000 students. The Main Building was the original location of Drexel University and still serves as a place for classes and administrative offices.

        <h1>Lebow Hall</h1>
        <p>The 12-story, 177,500-square-foot home for LeBow College of Business is located at the heart of the Drexel University campus, at the intersection of Woodland Walk and Market Street, where it forms a gateway to Drexel and a backdrop to the historic statue of A. J. Drexel (Moses Ezekiel, 1904). The diagonal massing of the lower floors follows Woodland Walk and combines with the new Papadakis Integrated Sciences Building (Diamond & Schmitt, 2011) to energize the University’s central quadrangle.

        <h1>Papadakis Integrated Sciences Building</h1>
        <p>At Drexel, we encourage our students to pursue multidisciplinary research opportunities, working hands-on in and outside of the classroom. Thanks to the passion and ingenuity of our students and staff, we've made groundbreaking discoveries to the creation of new ideas, products, and services in sectors such as public policy, energy, health care, education, and information technology. The Papadakis Integrated Sciences Building's biowall, the largest biofilter in North America, is not only beautiful, but also purifies the indoor air.

        <h1>Daskalakis Athletic Center</h1>
        <p>Drexel students have a lot to choose from when it comes to being active. We have 18 Division I teams, from basketball to crew to field hockey. Students can also take part in club and intramural sports, a great way to meet other Drexel Dragons and have some fun. The Daskalakis Athletic Center, also known as the DAC, is the home of Drexel Athletics. Here, students can take a swim, play some squash, scale an indoor rock-climbing wall, and more.

        <h1>Perelman Center for Jewish Life</h1>
        <p>Drexel’s Raymond G. Perelman Center for Jewish Life only opened at the end of last October, but it’s already racking up praise in the press for its unique architectural design. The striking brick building, which was designed to resemble a menorah, was named to a Dec. 30 list from Wired titled “25 Masterpieces That Prove 2016 Was an Incredible Year for Architecture.” The Perelman Center for Jewish Life was ranked No. 13 (Philly’s other listing, the Pennovation Center, came in at No. 23).
